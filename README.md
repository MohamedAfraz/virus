# Virus Prank
## How to create a harmless virus prank using Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition


<br>

Paste this code in a new ```Notepad File```:
```
X=MsgBox("Message Description",0+16,"Title")
```

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to select ```All Files``` in the drop down menu and save the file as ```.vbs``` <br>
Something like ```Minecraft.vbs```

<br><br>

### 1.  You can Type any number from ```0 to 5``` instead of 0 (before the '+' symbol) <br>
> [!TIP]
> Below is the meaning of each number:
<br><br>
```0``` = OK Button | <br>
```1``` = OK / Cancel Button | <br>
```2``` = Abort / Retry / Ignore Button | <br>
```3``` = Yes / No / Cancel Button | <br>
```4``` = Yes / No Button | <br>
```5``` = Retry / Cancel Button | <br>

<br> <br> 

### 2.  You can type 32 or 48 or 64 instead of 16. <br>
> [!TIP]
> Below is the meaning of each number:
<br> <br>
```16``` = Critical Icon | <br>
```32``` = Help Icon | <br>
```48``` = Warning Icon | <br>
```64``` = Information Icon | <br>

<br> <br>


### 3.  Feel free to change the ```Title``` and ```Message Description``` Placeholder Text

> [!TIP]
> Change the ```Description``` to something like ```Your Computer has been infected with a Virus. Delete all System Files Now!```<br>
And ```Title``` to something like ```Windows Firewall Alert x64```



<br> <br>

### 4.  Send the file to your friends and tell then to run it after installation
<br>

> [!CAUTION]
> Get ready to ```Lose Friends``` with this one <br> XD
